Title: Estimation of Smooth Hazard Models for Interval-Censored Data with Applications to Survival and Illness-Death Models
Version: 1.2.7
Author: Celia Touraine, Pierre Joly, Thomas A. Gerds
Description: Estimation of two-state (survival) models and irreversible illness-death 
    models with possibly interval-censored,left-truncated and right-censored data.
    Proportional intensities regression models can be specificed to allow for covariates effects separately for each 
    transition. We use either a parametric approach with Weibull
    baseline intensities or a semi-parametric approach with M-splines
    approximation of baseline intensities in order to obtain smooth estimates of the hazard functions.
    Parameter estimates are obtained by maximum likelihood in the
    parametric approach and by  penalized maximum likelihood in the
    semi-parametric approach.
